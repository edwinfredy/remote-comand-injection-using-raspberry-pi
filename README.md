# Remote Command Injection Using Raspberry Pi
This project involves creating a USB Rubber Ducky using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pico registers itself as a keyboard and injects keystrokes into the target device, establishing a reverse shell. \
There is also a React-based GUI that uses the reverse shell to navigate the target filesystem as well. \
**Note:** This project is made strictly for educational purposes. Use it only in controlled environments and with all necessary permissions.
